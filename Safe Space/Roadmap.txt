Main file must be link to whole process.

Data will be stored in:
    > Test_Name
        > GPSfile.txt
        > truth.json
        > VANTAGEfile.jason

Truthfile Format:
    jsonencode(truth):
        truth: a 1 x n struct where each ith element corresponds to the ith time
            truth(i).t the ith time
            turh(i).cubesat1position (the name might need some "_"s to make josh happy)
                this be a 3x1 vector

Options:
    > Import truth data:
        - Select file
        - Extract relevant data
        - Data is saved to truth.json automagically
        - Plot truth data
    > Look at VANTAGE performance for this test
        - Probably plots of stuff. IDK yet
        - If VANTAGE not available plot truth by itself
    > Correlate performance over several tests
        - Select relevant folders (include "all" button)
        - Do covariance analysis and make error plots
